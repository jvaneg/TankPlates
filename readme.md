# Tank Plates 1.4.0

* For 1.12 wow client
* Requires [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW/)
* Update both SuperWoW and this addon if you experience errors

## Features

* Colors enemy plates depending on if they're attacking you
* Text highlight for the enemy you're targeting
* MT/OT role assignment to identify when non-tanks pull aggro

### Tank Role Commands

Use `/tp` to manage Main Tank (MT) and Off Tank (OT) assignments in raids:

* `/tp` - Show current tank assignments
* `/tp add mt [name]` - Assign a player as Main Tank
* `/tp add ot [name]` - Assign a player as Off Tank
* `/tp remove mt [name]` - Remove Main Tank assignment
* `/tp remove ot [name]` - Remove Off Tank assignment
* `/tp clear` - Clear all tank assignments

**Color Guide:**
* Green - You have aggro, or MT has aggro
* Dark Green - OT has aggro
* Red - Non-tank has aggro (DPS/healer pulled!)
* Yellow - Enemy is crowd controlled

## Bugs / Missing Features

* Not fully compatable with ShaguTweaks nameplates, but compatable with pfUI and ShaguPlates. Turn off ShaguTweaks nameplate options to use TankPlates.
