# Tank Plates 1.4.1 \[Jonaldo Edition\]

* For 1.12 wow client
* Requires [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW/)
* Update both SuperWoW and this addon if you experience errors

## Features

* Colors enemy plates depending on who they're attacking
* Text highlight for the enemy you're targeting
* Support for multiple tanks with easy GUI management

### Tank Management

Use `/tp` to open the tank list window and manage multiple tanks.

**Color Guide:**
* Bright Green - You have aggro
* Dark Green - Another tank has aggro
* Red - Non-tank has aggro (DPS/healer pulled!)
* Yellow - Enemy is crowd controlled

## Compatibility & Notes

* Colours were previously not being passed through correctly to *ShaguPlates* nameplates; this is now fixed and TankPlates works with **ShaguPlates**.
* Probably does not work with class colour option in ShaguPlates.
* Other tank functions should now behave correctly when using supported nameplate addons.
